<h1>Rainfall Prediction using machine Learning</h1>

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>


Climate is a important aspect of human life. So, the Prediction should accurate as much as possible. In this project we try to deal with the prediction of the rainfall which is also a major aspect of human life and which provide the major resource of human life which is Fresh Water.<br>
Now climate change is the biggest issue all over the world. Peoples are working on to detect the patterns in climate change as it affects the economy in production to infrastructure. So as in rainfall also making prediction of rainfall is a challenging task with a good accuracy rate. Making prediction on rainfall cannot be done by the traditional way, so scientist is using machine learning and deep learning to find out the pattern for rainfall prediction.

<h2>Objective</h2>

Rainfall forecasting is very important because heavy and irregular rainfall can have many impacts like destruction of crops and farms, damage of property so a better forecasting model is essential for an early warning that can minimize risks to life and property and also managing the agricultural farms in better way. This prediction mainly helps farmers and also water resources can be utilized efficiently. Rainfall prediction is a challenging task and the results should be accurate.

<h2>Dataset Used</h2>


The CSV file contains-

SUBDIVISION: Regions considered due to similar topological features

YEAR: Year in which rainfall occurred.

The next 12 columns are the different months

The last 4 columns are the cumulative time period to show the seasons.
